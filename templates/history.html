          <h2>Labrinth</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Timothy Lee McKenzie (born 4 January 1989), better known by his
            stage name Labrinth, is an English singer, rapper, songwriter, and
            record producer. Labrinth signed as a recording artist with Simon
            Cowell's record label Syco Music in 2010, initially collaborating
            with the English rapper Tinie Tempah. He appeared as a featured
            artist: uncredited on the single "Pass Out", but later officially on
            "Frisky"; then he released his first solo single, "Let the Sun
            Shine" in September. All three songs peaked in the top five on the
            UK Singles Chart.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          His debut album, Electronic Earth (2012), peaked at number two on the
          UK Albums Chart and spawned four top five singles there. The single
          "Beneath Your Beautiful" became his first song to reach the top 40 on
          the US Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number one in the United
          Kingdom, also receiving a nomination for Best British Single at the
          Brit Awards. In November 2014, he released the single "Jealous", which
          was later certified Platinum in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, Labrinth formed the supergroup LSD with Australian singer Sia
          and American DJ and producer Diplo. The group released their
          self-titled debut album the following year. Also in 2019, in October,
          he composed the Season 1 Official Score for the HBO drama series
          Euphoria; it received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning
          one for the single "All for Us". His second album, Imagination & the
          Misfit Kid, followed in November.
        </p>
        <p>
          Labrinth continued composing for Euphoria in 2022, and the Season 2
          Official Score was released in April. The score earned him an
          additional two Primetime Emmy nominations, for the songs "I'm Tired"
          and "Elliot's Song", both written alongside Zendaya.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has been referred to as "one of the most important British
          musicians of his generation". Labrinth has worked with numerous
          artists as a songwriter and producer including Beyoncé, Rihanna, Nicki
          Minaj, Eminem, Kanye West, and the Weeknd. His production work on the
          Weeknd's album Beauty Behind the Madness earned him a Grammy Award for
          Album of the Year nomination. He also co-produced the soundtrack The
          Lion King: The Gift, and co-wrote the single "Spirit", alongside
          Beyoncé and Ilya Salmanzadeh, for which he received nominations at the
          Grammy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and the Critics' Choice Movie
          Awards.

          <h2>Rammstein</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Rammstein is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed in Berlin in
            1994. The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann,
            lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers,
            bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist
            Christian "Flake" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their
            history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of
            Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces
            the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their
            formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts
            Feeling B and First Arsch.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          After winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record demos and
          send them to different record labels, eventually signing with Motor
          Music. Working with producer Jacob Hellner, they released their debut
          album Herzeleid in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the
          band gained popularity through their live performances and the album
          eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, Sehnsucht,
          was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a
          worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful
          singles "Engel" and "Du hast" and the live album Live aus Berlin
          (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label
          Universal Music and released Mutter in 2001. Six singles were released
          from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead
          single, "Sonne", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released Reise,
          Reise in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: "Mein
          Teil" and "Amerika"; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming
          their first No. 1 single.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their fifth album, Rosenrot, was released in 2005, and the lead
          single, "Benzin", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album,
          Völkerball, was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album,
          Liebe ist für alle da, in 2009, with its lead single, "Pussy",
          becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a
          controversial music video that featured hardcore pornography. The band
          then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years,
          releasing the Made in Germany greatest hits album as well as the
          Rammstein in Amerika and Paris live albums. After a decade without new
          music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song "Deutschland", which
          became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their untitled seventh
          studio album was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14
          countries. While sheltering during COVID-19 lockdowns, the band
          spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, Zeit,
          which was released in April 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the Neue
          Deutsche Härte genre, with their debut album leading the music press
          to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a
          positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been
          very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and
          platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand
          live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have contributed
          to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been
          subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been
          criticized; for instance, the song "Ich tu dir weh" forced its parent
          album Liebe ist für alle da to be re-released in Germany with the song
          removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.

          <h2>Fall Out Boy</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois,
            a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and
            rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist
            Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from
            Chicago's hardcore punk scene and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as
            a pop-punk side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group
            went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their
            debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003), became an underground
            success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy
            touring. Take This to Your Grave is cited as influential on pop-punk
            music in the 2000s.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer,
          Fall Out Boy's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork
          Tree, produced two hit singles, "Sugar, We're Goin Down" and "Dance,
          Dance". It went double platinum, transforming the group into
          superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out
          Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards.
          Infinity on High (2007) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200
          with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles,
          "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" and "Thnks fr th Mmrs". Their
          following album, Folie à Deux (2008), was a commercial disappointment
          and received a mixed response. Following the release of Believers
          Never Die – Greatest Hits in 2009, the band went on hiatus and the
          members worked on side projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band reunited with Save Rock and Roll (2013), which became Fall
          Out Boy's second number-one album, and included the top 20 single "My
          Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)". The same year, the
          band released the EP PAX AM Days, consisting of eight punk-influenced
          tracks that were recorded during a two-day session with producer Ryan
          Adams. The band's sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho
          (2015) peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and spawned the
          top-10 hit "Centuries" and the single "Uma Thurman" which reached No.
          22 on the Billboard Hot 100. This was followed by their first remix
          album Make America Psycho Again, which featured remixes of all
          original tracks from American Beauty/American Psycho by a different
          artist on each song, including Migos and Wiz Khalifa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band's seventh studio album Mania (2018), also peaked at No. 1,
          making it the band's fourth No. 1 album and sixth consecutive Top 10
          album. The Mania tour included a show at Wrigley Field, marking their
          first headlining stadium show. In 2018, Fall Out Boy also received
          their second Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album for Mania. On
          January 18, 2023, the group announced its eighth studio album, So Much
          (for) Stardust, which was released on March 24.
